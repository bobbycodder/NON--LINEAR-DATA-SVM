# svm kernal with non _linear dataset :
## I have taken non-linear dataset for model prediction 
## Firstly I've done model prediction with RBF kernal and my accuaracy is 100%
## Then I've updated the feature  { adding more faeture to update the dimenssion of the dataset }
## With the help of feature  addition my accuracy become 100% 


 I've implemented the concept of [Kernels in SVM](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/svm-classification-scikit-learn-python#kernels).

**Just a practice [notebook]()!**
